    All the computers need to have operating system. Without the operating system <br>
    A computer cannot work. Operating System is the basic requirement of all computers. 
    Operating System is the special software that controls and manages<br> the overall operation 
    of a computer. <br>
    <p>
        <element class="func" >
        <strong>Some Basic Functions of Operating System are: <br></strong>
    1. It manages and controls input/output devices. <br>
    2. It manages computer memory (RAM and Secondary storage device) <br>
    3. It provides the enironment to run other software <br>
    4. It notifies the user about any fault that may occur in the computer. <br>

    Programs can be written by using different programming languages. Computer programs 
    can be written in any programming language is known as Source Codes. But  a computer 
    can only understand the program written in machine lanugage (Binary Language). So the 
    Programs written in other languages need to convert into machine language programs. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <element class="typesoflp">
    Types of Language Processors are: <br>
    1. Assembler <br>
    2. Interpreter <br>
    3. Compiler <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    <element class="lpt">
        <b>Assembler:</b> Assembler is the language processor that converts programs written in assembly 
        language (low level language) into machine language. The assembler translates the source code 
        in assembly language to machine language program. The convertred program is known as Object Code. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <element class="enter">
    <b>Interpreter:</b> Interpreter is the language processer that converts programs writtin in
    high level language into machine language. It translates one statement at a time into machine
    language and directs to the CPU. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <element class="last">
    <b>Compiler:</b> Compiler is the language processor that converts programs written in 
    high level language into machine language. The compiler reads all the statements of the 
    program and translates the source code into program in machine language. <br>
    Some high level languages that use compiler are: <br>
    C, C++, Java, Python, C#, Swift, Ruby, QuickBasic etc.

    <header>Utility Software</header>
    <p>
        <element class="utility">
    Utility software (also called System Utility) is a kind of system software that
    is designed to take care and maintain the computer. The utility software keeps
    the computer in good working condition. The utility software perfrom the tasks
    like searching and recovering of lost data and file, searhing and removing computer
    viruses, downloading files from websites etc. <br>
    Download Acceletor Plus(DAP), Virus Scanning Software, Backup software and Sandisk
    are some example of utility software.
